# Marketing Design

Guidance for landing pages, marketing sites, promotional materials, and creative artifacts. The philosophy: **bold intentionality that makes an impression.**

Users encounter these interfaces once. First impressions matter. The design should be memorable — distinct enough that someone could describe it from memory.


## Commit to a Direction

Don't blend into the sea of generic marketing sites. Pick a bold aesthetic and execute it with conviction:

**Brutally Minimal** — Dramatic negative space, stark typography, almost nothing on the page. What remains carries immense weight.

**Maximalist Chaos** — Dense, layered, overwhelming in the best way. Every corner rewards attention.

**Luxury & Refined** — Premium materials, subtle animations, quiet confidence. Feels expensive.

**Lo-Fi & Zine** — Raw, handmade, imperfect on purpose. Scanned textures, marker fonts, DIY energy.

**Dark & Moody** — Deep backgrounds, dramatic lighting, cinematic atmosphere.

**Soft & Pastel** — Gentle colors, rounded shapes, approachable warmth.

**Editorial & Magazine** — Strong grid, beautiful typography, content as hero.

**Retro-Futuristic** — Nostalgic tech aesthetics reimagined. CRT glow, pixel influences, chrome gradients.

**Handcrafted & Artisanal** — Organic shapes, natural textures, human imperfection.

**Art Deco & Geometric** — Bold geometry, metallic accents, elegant symmetry.

These are starting points. The final design should feel singular — every detail working in service of one cohesive direction.


## Typography as Voice

Typography carries the design's personality. This is where you take risks.

**Display type should be expressive, even risky.** Interesting, unusual fonts that you'd never use in an application. The headline font often defines the entire aesthetic.

**Body text should be legible but refined.** It can have personality while remaining readable.

**Never default.** Skip Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts. These signal default thinking. Every font choice should be inseparable from the aesthetic direction.

Work the full typographic range:
- Dramatic size contrasts (96px headlines, 14px body)
- Weight as emphasis (thin to black within one family)
- Case as design element (all caps, small caps, mixed)
- Letter-spacing as texture (tight headlines, airy labels)


## Color That Commits

Palettes should take a clear position:

- **Bold and saturated** — confident, energetic, impossible to ignore
- **Moody and restrained** — sophisticated, atmospheric, mysterious
- **High-contrast minimal** — black/white with one electric accent
- **Unexpected combinations** — colors that shouldn't work but do

Lead with a dominant color. Punctuate with sharp accents. Avoid timid, non-committal distributions where every color gets equal weight.


## Spatial Composition

Break expectations:

- **Asymmetry** — balance without mirror symmetry
- **Overlap and z-depth** — elements that break out of their containers
- **Diagonal flow** — movement that isn't strictly horizontal/vertical
- **Grid-breaking elements** — one element that ignores the system
- **Dramatic scale jumps** — giant headlines next to tiny labels
- **Full-bleed moments** — edge-to-edge impact
- **Controlled density OR generous negative space** — commit to one

The layout itself should feel designed, not just filled in.


## Backgrounds & Atmosphere

Don't default to solid colors. Create atmosphere and depth:

- **Gradient meshes** — organic, flowing color transitions
- **Noise and grain** — texture that feels physical
- **Geometric patterns** — repeated shapes as visual rhythm
- **Layered transparencies** — glassmorphism, overlapping translucent panels
- **Dramatic shadows and glows** — light as design element
- **Parallax depth** — layers that move independently
- **Decorative borders and clip-paths** — shaped containers
- **Print textures** — halftone, duotone, stipple effects
- **Knockout typography** — text that reveals background

Every technique should serve the aesthetic direction, not demonstrate capability.


## Motion for Impact

Animation should create moments, not constant movement.

**Prioritize high-impact entrances.** One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use `animation-delay` to choreograph elements appearing in sequence.

**Scroll-triggered reveals.** Elements that animate into view as you scroll down. The page unfolds like a story.

**Hover states that surprise.** Interactions that reward curiosity — elements that transform, reveal, or respond unexpectedly.

**Cursor effects.** Custom cursors, elements that follow or react to mouse position.

For React, use Motion (Framer Motion) when available. For vanilla HTML/CSS, push CSS animations and transitions as far as they go.


## The Anti-Slop Checklist

Generic AI-generated marketing sites share telltale patterns. Avoid:

- **Overused fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk, system stacks
- **Clichéd palettes**: Purple gradients on white, teal and coral, "startup blue"
- **Predictable layouts**: Hero → features grid → testimonials → CTA (without variation)
- **Stock photography energy**: Even with real photos, generic composition
- **Decorative blobs**: Floating gradient shapes with no purpose
- **"Modern" without meaning**: Glass cards, subtle gradients, soft shadows — assembled without vision

Every choice should be rooted in the specific context. Ask: "Would I remember this site tomorrow?"


## Marketing Anti-Patterns

Beyond the universal anti-patterns:

- **Safe choices** — if it could be any company's site, it's too generic
- **Decoration without purpose** — every visual element should reinforce the direction
- **Inconsistent commitment** — bold headline but timid everything else
- **Following trends blindly** — bento grids because everyone has bento grids
- **Complexity as craft** — elaborate !== good; restraint can be bold too


## The Standard

Marketing interfaces should be memorable. Someone should be able to describe the site from memory: "the one with the giant typography and the dark background" or "the one that felt like a magazine."

Think award-winning creative work — sites that make you pause and look closer. Every design should feel like it could only belong to this specific product.

Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. The key is intentionality, not intensity. Commit to a direction and execute it with conviction.
