# Workflow

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/how-to-use-diataxis/

Diátaxis functions as both a documentation content framework and a methodology for documentation work itself. Rather than serving as a rigid implementation plan, it operates as a navigational guide helping documentation teams understand their work and identify improvement opportunities.

## Core Principles

### Structure Emerges from Improvement

The framework explicitly advises against pre-creating empty structural divisions. Instead, "Diátaxis changes the structure of your documentation from the inside" through incremental improvements that naturally coalesce into the four-part model (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation).

### Iterative Small Steps

The methodology emphasizes working incrementally rather than attempting comprehensive overhauls. "Don't try to work on the big picture" — instead, publish improvements as you make them, even if individually modest.

### The Four-Step Workflow

The recommended approach involves:

1. Selecting any documentation piece, however small
2. Assessing it against Diátaxis principles
3. Identifying one beneficial action
4. Completing and publishing that single change

Then repeating the cycle.

## Organic Growth Model

Documentation should develop "like a living organism...built itself up from the inside-out, one cell at a time." The framework distinguishes between "finished" and "complete" — documentation is never truly finished but should always be functionally complete and useful at its current developmental stage.

This approach prioritizes responsive, adaptive work over planning-intensive processes, reducing the paralysis that often accompanies documentation projects.

## Don't try to work on the big picture

Don't try to reorganize all your documentation at once. Don't create a grand plan. Instead:

- Pick something small
- Make it better
- Publish the improvement
- Repeat

## Don't create empty structures

Don't create empty "Tutorials", "How-to", "Reference", "Explanation" sections and try to fill them. Let the structure emerge from the content as you improve it piece by piece.

## The cycle of improvement

1. **Look at existing documentation** - Pick any piece
2. **Assess it** - What kind of documentation is it? What kind should it be?
3. **Identify one action** - What's one thing that would make it better?
4. **Do it** - Make the change and publish it
5. **Repeat** - Go back to step 1
