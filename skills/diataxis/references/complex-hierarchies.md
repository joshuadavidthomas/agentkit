# Diátaxis in complex hierarchies

## Structure of Documentation Content

Diátaxis can organize documentation hierarchically, starting with a home page and branching into four main categories: tutorials, how-to guides, reference materials, and explanations. Each section typically has its own landing page that provides context.

Additional hierarchy layers can be added when needed. For instance, installation guides might be subdivided into separate approaches like local installation, Docker, virtual machines, and Linux containers.

## Contents Pages

Landing pages and home pages serve as overviews of their encompassed material. The design of these pages significantly affects user experience.

### Managing List Length

"Seven items seems to be a comfortable general limit." Lists exceeding this threshold become difficult to scan unless they follow natural ordering (numerical or alphabetical). When tables of contents grow longer, breaking them into smaller groupings improves readability.

The guiding principle remains user experience. "As always, what matters most is the experience of the reader."

### Effective Landing Page Design

"The content of a landing page itself should read like an overview." Rather than merely listing links, landing pages should introduce their content through headings and contextual text snippets. This approach treats documentation as authored for human readers rather than as a structural scheme to be filled.

## Two-Dimensional Problems

Documentation complexity increases when Diátaxis intersects with other organizing structures — such as different user types or deployment platforms. A product used in different contexts (land, sea, air) or by different audiences (users, developers, contributors) presents organizational challenges.

Two potential structures emerge:

1. Group by use case first, then apply Diátaxis within each group
2. Apply Diátaxis first, then subdivide each category by use case

Both approaches involve repetition and raise questions about shared content.

### Understanding the Core Issue

"Diátaxis is not a scheme into which documentation must be placed — four boxes." Rather, it identifies four documentation types around which to structure content. The framework itself doesn't prescribe exactly four hierarchical divisions.

## Diátaxis as an Approach

Diátaxis functions as a working methodology identifying user needs, not merely as a diagram or structural template. Following these principles typically produces clear divisions into four categories, but this organizational outcome serves the approach rather than defining it.

## User-First Thinking

"Diátaxis is underpinned by attention to user needs," guiding structural decisions. Documentation should reflect how users perceive and interact with products, not how creators conceive them.

Determining whether a product serves fundamentally different users should shape documentation organization. If users, developers, and contributors need different knowledge levels, perhaps tutorial content could flow from user-facing to developer-facing material, while separating contributor guides entirely.

### Embracing Complex Structures When Necessary

"Documentation should be as complex as it needs to be." Complex structures remain navigable when they follow logical patterns matching user needs. The goal isn't simplicity for its own sake but rather clarity and coherence serving the people reading the documentation.
