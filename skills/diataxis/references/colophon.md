Diátaxis is the work of [Daniele Procida](https://vurt.eu).

It has been developed over a number of years, and continues to be elaborated and explored.

## Origins and development

An earlier presentation of some of these ideas was created while working at Divio between 2014-2021.

The original context for the Diátaxis approach was limited to software product documentation.

In 2021 Daniele was awarded a Fellowship of the Software Sustainability Institute, to explore its application in scientific research contexts. More recently the application has been explored in internal corporate documentation, organisational management and education, and also its application at scale. This work is on-going.

Other people have corresponded to share their experience of applying Diátaxis to note-taking systems and even as part of a systematic approach to household management.
