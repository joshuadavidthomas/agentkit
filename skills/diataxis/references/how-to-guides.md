# How-to guides

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/

A how-to guide is a **response to a question** that only a user with some experience could even formulate. How-to guides are **goal-oriented**.

---

A how-to guide addresses a real-world goal or problem, by providing practical directions to help the user who is already competent enough to formulate the goal or understand the problem.

In how-to guides, the user has work to do. The user is at work, not at study.

How-to guides serve the user's _application_ of skill and knowledge - their work. Its purpose is to help the user get something done.

## Core Principles

### User-Centered Focus

The guides must address real-world problems from the user's perspective, not the tool's capabilities. "Tools appear in how-to guides as incidental bit-players, the means to the user's end." This distinction separates meaningful guidance from mere mechanical instructions.

### Practical Over Complete

Guides should omit unnecessary information. "Practical usability is more helpful than completeness," allowing readers to integrate instructions into their own workflows rather than following rigid procedures.

### Logical Sequencing

Steps should follow a natural order reflecting how users think and work. Consider both temporal requirements (step B depends on step A) and cognitive flow—how information connects meaningfully in a user's mind.

### Clear Naming

Titles must state exactly what the guide demonstrates. Prefer "How to integrate application performance monitoring" over vague alternatives that leave the guide's purpose ambiguous.

### Provide a set of directions that address a specific goal or problem

A how-to guide must address a specific question or problem. Don't try to make it more comprehensive than it needs to be.

### Don't explain concepts

A how-to guide is not the place for explanation. If explanation is important, link to it. This keeps the guide focused on what the user needs to do.

### Allow for some flexibility

A how-to guide should be adaptable. The user may need to apply it in different contexts or with variations. Where possible, present alternatives: "If you are using x, do a; if you prefer y, do b instead."

### Omit the unnecessary

Practical usability is more helpful than completeness. How-to guides should be efficient and to the point.

## The language of how-to guides

**How to integrate application performance monitoring** - Name guides clearly, starting with "How to..."

**If you want x, do y. To achieve a, do b.** - Conditional imperatives.

**Refer to the x reference guide for a full list of options.** - Don't pollute with reference material. Link to it.

## Applied to food and cooking

Think of a recipe as a how-to guide. A recipe tells an already-competent cook how to make a particular dish. It's not there to teach you how to cook. It assumes you can already handle basic techniques. A recipe addresses a specific goal: producing a specific dish. It contains a set of steps, and it might offer some variations or alternatives ("you can substitute...").

A recipe is reliable because it solves a specific problem, and it does so in a way that respects the user's existing competence.
