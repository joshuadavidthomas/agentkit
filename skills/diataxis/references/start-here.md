## The Four Kinds of Documentation

Diátaxis identifies four fundamental documentation types serving different purposes:

**Tutorials**: A tutorial is a lesson, that takes a student by the hand through a learning experience. Tutorials are practical, with learners performing tasks under guidance. Example: "Let's create a simple game in Python."

**How-to Guides**: These address a real-world goal or problem, by providing practical directions. Unlike tutorials, how-to guides target competent users handling actual work rather than learning.

**Reference**: Reference documentation provides the technical description - facts - that a user needs in order to do things correctly. This material remains neutral and factual, structured like maps reflecting the subject's architecture.

**Explanation**: These guides provide context and background and answer the question "why?" They help users understand bigger pictures and connections.

## The Diátaxis Framework

The framework uses two axes:

- **Action vs. Cognition**: Tutorials and how-to guides involve doing; reference and explanation involve understanding
- **Acquisition vs. Application**: Tutorials and explanation support learning; how-to guides and reference support working

## The Compass Table

| Content Type | Informs | Serves | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tutorials | Action | Skill acquisition | Learning by doing |
| How-to guides | Action | Skill application | Practical work |
| Reference | Cognition | Skill application | Information lookup |
| Explanation | Cognition | Skill acquisition | Understanding context |

## Practical Workflow

The recommended approach involves:

1. Examining current documentation
2. Identifying improvement opportunities
3. Selecting one small improvement
4. Implementing it
5. Repeating the process

## Key Principle

The framework emphasizes pragmatism: "You don't have to believe in it and there is no exam." Users benefit most when consulting this guidance during actual documentation challenges.
