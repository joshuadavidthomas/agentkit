# The map

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/map/

Diátaxis presents a **two-dimensional structure** for organizing documentation rather than a simple list. This framework positions different documentation types in relationship to one another, creating a mental map where boundaries between categories clarify their distinctions.

## The Problem of Structure

Documentation often fails due to architectural issues that extend beyond mere structural problems. Without a clear, generalized framework, creators typically organize content around product features — an approach that generates inconsistency across multiple documentation sets.

"Any orderly attempt to organise documentation into clear content categories will help improve it (for authors as well as users)." However, authors frequently struggle when content doesn't fit existing categories or when selecting between competing organizational schemes.

## Expectations and Guidance

Clear organization provides two critical benefits: reader expectations and author guidance. The framework defines four documentation types:

| Type | Purpose | Answers | Orientation | Form |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|------|
| **Tutorials** | Introduce, educate, lead | "Can you teach me to...?" | Learning | A lesson |
| **How-to guides** | Guide | "How do I...?" | Goals | Series of steps |
| **Reference** | State, describe, inform | "What is...?" | Information | Dry description |
| **Explanation** | Explain, clarify, discuss | "Why...?" | Understanding | Discursive explanation |

## Blur and Boundary Erosion

Documentation systems naturally exhibit "affinities between each of the different forms" and neighboring categories. When distinctions blur, documentation becomes less effective. The worst case involves tutorials and how-to guides collapsing into each other, undermining both formats' purposes.

## The Cycle of Interaction

Diátaxis maps a documentation journey reflecting how users develop expertise:

1. **Learning-oriented phase**: Initial skill acquisition through guided practice
2. **Goal-oriented phase**: Applying learned skills to achieve objectives
3. **Information-oriented phase**: Consulting technical reference for needed knowledge
4. **Explanation-oriented phase**: Reflecting on practice and deepening understanding

This cycle repeats as users master new topics or deepen existing knowledge. Users may enter this cycle at any point based on their immediate needs.
