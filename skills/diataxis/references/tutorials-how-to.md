# The difference between a tutorial and how-to guide

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/

## Core Distinction

The fundamental difference centers on user needs. "Sometimes the user is **at study**, and sometimes the user is **at work**." Tutorials serve learners acquiring skills, while how-to guides assist practitioners applying existing competence.

## Key Characteristics

### Tutorials are learning-oriented:

- Provide structured, safe learning experiences
- Eliminate unexpected challenges
- Offer a single, carefully-managed path
- Assume no prior familiarity
- Teacher bears responsibility for success
- Teach general principles applicable across situations

### How-to guides are task-oriented:

- Direct already-competent users through specific tasks
- Prepare for real-world complications
- Branch with conditional alternatives ("if this, then that")
- Assume existing familiarity
- User bears responsibility for outcomes
- Focus on completing particular objectives

## Why Confusion Occurs

Both formats involve step-by-step directions, making them superficially similar. However, confusing them creates problems. "A clinical manual that conflated education with practice...would be a literally deadly document."

## Complexity Isn't the Distinguisher

Importantly, tutorials can address advanced topics, and how-to guides can cover basic procedures. The distinction depends on whether documentation serves "the user's study" or "their work," not complexity level.

## The test

Ask yourself: is this documentation for someone who is **learning** (at study), or for someone who is **working** (applying what they know)?

- If learning → Tutorial
- If working → How-to guide

This is the only question that matters. Everything else follows from it.
