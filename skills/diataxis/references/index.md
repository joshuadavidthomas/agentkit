# Diátaxis

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/

Diátaxis is a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring that addresses user needs through four distinct documentation types: **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference**, and **explanation**. These forms are organized systematically to match how people actually use documentation.

## Core Purpose

The framework addresses three fundamental documentation challenges:

- **Content**: What should be written
- **Style**: How it should be written
- **Architecture**: How it should be organized

## Key Benefits

Beyond helping documentation users, Diátaxis offers value to creators and maintainers through lightweight principles that are straightforward to implement without imposing technical constraints.
