# The compass

> Source: https://diataxis.fr/compass/

The Diátaxis compass is a practical tool for categorizing and improving documentation. Rather than relying solely on intuition, which can be misleading, authors can use this decision framework to determine what type of documentation is needed or how to improve existing content.

## Core Concept

The compass operates as a decision tree with two fundamental questions:

1. **Action or Cognition?** (practical doing vs. theoretical thinking)
2. **Acquisition or Application?** (learning new skills vs. using existing ones)

These four combinations yield the four documentation types:

| Content Focus | User Need | Documentation Type |
|---|---|---|
| Action | Skill acquisition | Tutorial |
| Action | Skill application | How-to guide |
| Cognition | Skill application | Reference |
| Cognition | Skill acquisition | Explanation |

## Practical Application

The compass is particularly effective when you think that you (or even the documentation in front of you) are doing one thing - but you are troubled by a sense of doubt.

Authors should use the compass's terminology flexibly, understanding that:

- *Action* means practical steps and doing
- *Cognition* means theoretical knowledge and thinking
- *Acquisition* refers to study
- *Application* refers to work

## Using the compass

When in doubt about what type of documentation you're writing or should be writing, ask:

1. **Am I describing action or cognition?** If action, you're in the practical half (tutorials/how-to). If cognition, you're in the theory half (reference/explanation).
2. **Is this for acquisition or application?** If acquisition (study), you're writing a tutorial or explanation. If application (work), you're writing a how-to guide or reference.

The questions can be applied at various scales — from individual sentences to entire documents — making this a versatile tool for documentation assessment and improvement.

## When to use it

Use the compass when:

- You're unsure what type of documentation to write
- Existing documentation feels wrong or mixed up
- You want to verify that content belongs where it is
- A piece of documentation is trying to do too many things at once
