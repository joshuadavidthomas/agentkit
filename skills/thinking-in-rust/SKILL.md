  Mental-model reset for Rust. Use when writing or reviewing code to shift from

  "Rustify this", "the Rust way", converting code to Rust, or when you spot patterns
  carried over from other languages — bare String/bool for domain concepts,
  kind+Option structs, wildcard enum matches (_ =>), Error(String), runtime

# Think in Rust

You already know Rust syntax. This skill changes your **defaults** — what you reach for first when modeling a domain, handling errors, or designing an API.

The core failure mode: writing Rust that compiles but thinks like Python, Java, or TypeScript. Bare `String` for domain types. `bool` for states. Trait objects for closed sets. `Error(String)` for everything. `_ =>` in every match. Index-based loops. Sentinel values. Getters and setters on every field. These compile. They are wrong.

Most of these habits come from languages without sum types, ownership, or zero-cost newtypes. Recognizing *where* a pattern comes from helps you see *why* it's wrong in Rust.

This skill is the **general-purpose entry point** for Rust code review. It establishes thinking-in-Rust defaults and recognizes patterns imported from other languages. For specialized problems, it delegates to **rust-error-handling** (thiserror vs anyhow, error boundaries), **rust-traits** (trait design, object safety, dispatch), **rust-ownership** (borrow checker errors, lifetime design), **rust-type-design** (typestate, phantom types, advanced builders), and **rust-project-structure** (workspace/crate organization, module layout).

Treat these as strong defaults, not rigid laws: when unsure, choose the approach that moves invariants into types and lets the compiler enforce them.

## How Rust Thinks

### Model the domain in types

**1. Every string with domain meaning is a newtype.** Bare `String` erases domain knowledge. The compiler can't distinguish an email from a username from a URL. Wrap it, validate at construction, keep the field private. See [references/newtypes-and-domain-types.md](references/newtypes-and-domain-types.md). *Authority: Rust API Guidelines [C-NEWTYPE]. std: `PathBuf`, `NonZero<u32>`.*

**2. Every boolean parameter is a lie — use an enum.** `true`/`false` carry no meaning at the call site and can't extend to a third state. Replace with a two-variant enum. Applies to struct fields too — correlated booleans are a state machine in disguise. See [references/bool-to-enum.md](references/bool-to-enum.md). *Authority: Rust API Guidelines [C-CUSTOM-TYPE]. clippy: `fn_params_excessive_bools`.*

**3. Every "I don't know" is explicit.** `Option<bool>` has three states but none of them are named. `vec![]` conflates "checked, found nothing" with "haven't checked." Make each state a named variant. See [references/option-bool-to-enum.md](references/option-bool-to-enum.md).

**4. Every match is exhaustive — no wildcard `_ =>` arms.** Wildcards silence the compiler when you add variants. List every variant of enums you control. The only acceptable `_ =>` is for `#[non_exhaustive]` foreign types and primitives. See [references/exhaustive-matching.md](references/exhaustive-matching.md). *Authority: clippy: `wildcard_enum_match_arm`, `match_wildcard_for_single_variants`.*

**5. Every error variant is a domain fact — no `Error(String)`.** String errors throw away structure. Callers can't match, test, or recover. Define a typed error enum for libraries; use `anyhow` for application binaries. See **rust-error-handling** for the full strategy. *Authority: Effective Rust Item 4. std: `io::ErrorKind`.*

**6. Parse, don't validate.** Validation checks data and throws away the proof. Parsing checks data and encodes the result in the type. After parsing, the type guarantees validity — no re-checking downstream. Parse at system boundaries, use domain types internally. See [references/parse-dont-validate.md](references/parse-dont-validate.md). *Authority: Alexis King. std: `NonZero<T>`, `IpAddr`, `SocketAddr`.*

**7. Enums are the primary modeling tool.** Rust enums are sum types. They represent closed sets: HTTP methods, AST nodes, config variants, state machines. A struct with a "kind" field plus `Option` fields is always an enum waiting to be written. See [references/enums-as-modeling-tool.md](references/enums-as-modeling-tool.md). *Authority: std: `IpAddr`, `Cow`, `Option`, `Result`.*

**8. Enums for closed sets, trait objects for open sets.** If you know all variants at compile time, use an enum (zero-cost, exhaustive matching, per-variant data). Use `dyn Trait` or generics only when the set is genuinely open (plugins, user-defined types). Default to `impl Trait`/generics over `Box<dyn Trait>` for function parameters. See **rust-traits** for the full decision framework.

**9. Borrow by default — own when intentional.** Functions should borrow unless they need ownership. Prefer `&str` over `&String`, `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>`, `&Path` over `&PathBuf`. Take ownership when storing, transforming-and-returning, or moving to another thread. See [references/borrow-by-default.md](references/borrow-by-default.md). *Authority: Effective Rust Items 14-15. Rust API Guidelines [C-CALLER-CONTROL].*

### Express intent in APIs and control flow

**10. Iterators over index loops.** `for i in 0..v.len()` bypasses iterator optimizations, risks off-by-one errors, and obscures intent. Use `.iter()`, `.enumerate()`, `.windows()`, `.zip()`. Iterators enable bounds-check elimination, vectorization, and fusion. See [references/iterators-over-indexing.md](references/iterators-over-indexing.md).

**11. `Option` over sentinel values.** `-1`, `""`, `u32::MAX` as "no value" markers are invisible to the type system. Use `Option<T>`. The compiler forces callers to handle absence. `Option<NonZeroU32>` even has the same size as `u32`. See [references/option-over-sentinels.md](references/option-over-sentinels.md).

**12. One struct per entity, not parallel collections.** Multiple `HashMap`s sharing keys means nothing guarantees they stay in sync. Group related data into a struct, store in a single `HashMap<Key, Entity>`. See [references/struct-collections.md](references/struct-collections.md).

**13. Transform over mutate.** For configuration and construction, prefer consuming `self` with method chaining over `&mut self` setters. Reserve `&mut self` for live objects being operated on. See [references/transform-over-mutate.md](references/transform-over-mutate.md).

**14. Restructure ownership before `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.** `Rc<RefCell>` trades compile-time borrow checking for runtime panics. First try: split borrows, pass `&mut` through parameters, use arena/index patterns for graphs. See [references/ownership-before-refcell.md](references/ownership-before-refcell.md). See also **rust-ownership** for borrow checker strategies.

**15. Modules are namespaces, not `impl` blocks.** A unit struct with only associated functions is a Java class in disguise. Use modules for namespacing free functions. Use extension traits when you need method syntax on existing types. See [references/impl-namespace.md](references/impl-namespace.md).

**16. Right-size your pattern matching.** `matches!()` for boolean checks. `if let` for one variant. `let ... else` for one variant with early return. `match` for two or more variants. Full exhaustive `match` when adding a variant should break the build. See [references/pattern-matching-tools.md](references/pattern-matching-tools.md).

**17. Public fields over trivial getters.** If any value of the field's type is valid, make it `pub`. Don't write `get_x()`/`set_x()` that just forward to a field. When you do need accessors, use Rust naming: `name()` not `get_name()`. See [references/getter-setter.md](references/getter-setter.md). *Authority: Rust API Guidelines [C-GETTER].*

**18. Visibility is a design tool, not an afterthought.** When everything is `pub` or everything lives in one file, you haven't designed an API surface. Use modules to group by domain, `pub use` to curate what's exported, and `pub(crate)` / private to enforce boundaries. See [references/visibility-and-modules.md](references/visibility-and-modules.md). See also **rust-project-structure** for crate/workspace organization.

## Common Mistakes (Agent Failure Modes)

- **Public newtype fields (`pub struct Email(pub String)`)** → Make the field private; force construction through `parse`/`new` so invariants can't be bypassed.
- **Boolean flags leaking into APIs** → Replace with enums, even when there are only two states today.
- **"Kind" field + `Option` payload fields** → Replace with an enum carrying per-variant data; delete the `Option` fields.
- **Wildcard matches on your own enums** → List every variant; adding a variant should break the build.
- **Validation that returns `Result<(), E>`** → Parse once at the boundary into a domain type; pass the domain type forward.
- **`Error(String)` / `anyhow::Error` in a library** → Define a structured error enum; reserve `anyhow` for application boundaries.
- **Taking ownership by default** → Borrow (`&str`, `&[T]`, `&Path`) unless you store/return/transfer ownership.
- **`.clone()` as first resort** → Restructure to separate read/write phases, split borrows, or use indices.
- **Everything `pub`** → Treat `pub` as a semver commitment in libraries; use `pub(crate)` for internal sharing.
- **Defaulting to `dyn Trait`** → A habit from interface-oriented languages. In Rust, enums and generics are usually better.
