# salsa-overview

The "start here" skill for [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa), the incremental computation framework for Rust. Covers the mental model, core concepts (database, inputs, tracked functions, tracked structs, interned structs, accumulators, revisions), and routes to specialized skills.

The `SKILL.md` provides concept orientation and a routing table. The `references/` directory contains scale calibration data from real-world projects.
