# salsa-accumulators

Side-channel output for diagnostics and reporting: accumulator usage, the return-value diagnostic alternative, hybrid approaches, lazy span resolution, and multi-layer diagnostic aggregation pyramids.

The `SKILL.md` provides the pattern comparison and decision guidance. The `references/` directory contains diagnostic architectures from projects using accumulators, return values, or both.
