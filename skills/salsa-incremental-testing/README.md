# salsa-incremental-testing

Proving that Salsa queries actually reuse cached results: event capture infrastructure, `WillExecute`/`DidValidateMemoizedValue` assertions, the setup→execute→mutate→assert pattern, and test database construction.

The `SKILL.md` provides the testing patterns and assertion helpers. The `references/` directory contains test infrastructure from mature and early-stage projects alike.
