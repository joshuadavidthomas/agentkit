# salsa-production-patterns

Guidance on graduating from a simple Salsa project to a production-grade system. Covers the three-level maturity model: Level 1 (accumulators, tracked structs, flat DB), Level 2 (LRU caching, durability tuning, `no_eq`), and Level 3 (return-value pyramids, interned IDs, side-tables, parallel warm-ups).

The `SKILL.md` provides the maturity matrix and graduation guidance. The `references/` directory contains examples of projects at each maturity level.
