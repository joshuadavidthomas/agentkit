Ask it to build one for your use case.\n\n# Skills\n\nSkills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.\n\nPi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about violations but remaining lenient.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Locations](#locations)\n- [How Skills Work](#how-skills-work)\n- [Skill Commands](#skill-commands)\n- [Skill Structure](#skill-structure)\n- [Frontmatter](#frontmatter)\n- [Validation](#validation)\n- [Example](#example)\n- [Skill Repositories](#skill-repositories)\n\n## Locations\n\n> **Security:** Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code the model invokes. Review skill content before use.\n\nPi loads skills from:\n\n- Global: `~/.pi/agent/skills/`\n- Project: `.pi/skills/`\n- Packages: `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`\n- Settings: `skills` array with files or directories\n- CLI: `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)\n\nDiscovery rules:\n- Direct `.md` files in the skills directory root\n- Recursive `SKILL.md` files under subdirectories\n\nDisable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).\n\n### Using Skills from Other Harnesses\n\nTo use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories to settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skills\": [\n    \"~/.claude/skills\",\n    \"~/.codex/skills\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFor project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.pi/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skills\": [\"../.claude/skills\"]\n}\n```\n\n## How Skills Work\n\n1. At startup, pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions\n2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)\n3. When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md (models don't always do this; use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)\n4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets\n\nThis is progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.\n\n## Skill Commands\n\nSkills register as `/skill:name` commands:\n\n```bash\n/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill\n/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments\n```\n\nArguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.\n\nToggle skill commands via `/settings` in interactive mode or in `settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enableSkillCommands\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nA skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions\n├── scripts/              # Helper scripts\n│   └── process.sh\n├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand\n│   └── api-reference.md\n└── assets/\n    └── template.json\n```\n\n### SKILL.md Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.\n---\n\n# My Skill\n\n## Setup\n\nRun once before first use:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd /path/to/skill && npm install\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Usage\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./scripts/process.sh <input>\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\nUse relative paths from the skill directory:\n\n```markdown\nSee [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.\n```\n\n## Frontmatter\n\nPer the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):\n\n| Field | Required | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Must match parent directory. |\n| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. |\n| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |\n| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |\n| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |\n| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental). |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |\n\n### Name Rules\n\n- 1-64 characters\n- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only\n- No leading/trailing hyphens\n- No consecutive hyphens\n- Must match parent directory name\n\nValid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`\nInvalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`\n\n### Description Best Practices\n\nThe description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.\n\nGood:\n```yaml\ndescription: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.\n```\n\nPoor:\n```yaml\ndescription: Helps with PDFs.\n```\n\n## Validation\n\nPi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:\n\n- Name doesn't match parent directory\n- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters\n- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens\n- Description exceeds 1024 characters\n\nUnknown frontmatter fields are ignored.\n\n**Exception:** Skills with missing description are not loaded.\n\nName collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nbrave-search/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── search.js\n└── content.js\n```\n\n**SKILL.md:**\n```markdown\n---\nname: brave-search\ndescription: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.\n---\n\n# Brave Search\n\n## Setup\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd /path/to/brave-search && npm install\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Search\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./search.js \"query\"              # Basic search\n./search.js \"query\" --content    # Include page content\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Extract Page Content\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./content.js https://example.com\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n## Skill Repositories\n\n- [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - Document processing (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx), web development\n- [Pi Skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) - Web search, browser automation, Google APIs, transcription\n"}]}}

So we can't just symlink them directly.\n\nHowever, I could:\n1. Have the install script generate the harness-specific files in a local `.build/` directory\n2. Then symlink that directory to the global locationOr simpler - just keep the current approach but fix the path handling.\n\nActually, looking at the install.sh, the pattern is clear:\n```bash\nSKILLS_DIR=\"$HOME/.agents/skills\"\nmkdir -p \"$SKILLS_DIR\"\n```\n\nIt uses absolute paths directly without PROJECT_ROOT. My fix is correct, let me test it."},{"type":"tool-call","content":{"toolName":"bash","args":{"command":"cd /home/josh/projects/joshuadavidthomas/agentkit && just agents-install"}}},{"type":"tool-result","content":"./scripts/install-agents.sh \n✓ opencode: code-analyzer.md\n✓ pi: code-analyzer.md\n✓ opencode: code-locator.md\n✓ pi: code-locator.md\n✓ opencode: code-pattern-finder.md\n✓ pi: code-pattern-finder.md\n✓ opencode: web-searcher.md\n✓ pi: web-searcher.md\n\nInstalled 4 agents\n"}]}}
