Add a prescriptive note (with citations) about module file layout conventions: prefer foo.rs + foo/bar.rs over foo/mod.rs; never have both; avoid mixing styles. Place brief rule in SKILL.md and details in references/workspaces-and-layout.md.

## Checklist
- [x] Update SKILL.md with a short prescriptive rule + link to reference
- [x] Update references/workspaces-and-layout.md with fuller guidance + authoritative citations
- [x] Ensure no broken links / consistent wording
- [x] Mark bean completed
