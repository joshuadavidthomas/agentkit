Add workflow pattern guidance for non-linear work (branching off for unrelated work, returning to original work, reconciling parallel lines, agent-specific parent selection) to jj-overview and jj-sharing skills.

## Checklist

- [x] Add 'Non-Linear Work' subsection to jj-overview Core Workflow section
- [x] Add 'Independent Parallel PRs' note to jj-sharing after Stacked PRs section
- [x] Review both changes for consistency and accuracy
