- [x] Read PLAN.md and identify next skill to build
- [x] Read referenced materials for that skill
- [x] Inspect existing skill patterns (salsa-*, reference skills)
- [x] Author the new skill file with correct frontmatter/structure
- [x] Validate formatting and conventions
- [x] Mark the skill DONE in PLAN.md
