Quality review of Rust skills marked done in PLAN.md.

## Checklist
- [x] Load skill-authoring guidelines
- [x] Read PLAN.md and PROMPT.md
- [x] Identify Rust skills with Status: done
- [x] For each completed skill: review/fix SKILL.md structure, references/, README attribution, tone, examples, common mistakes, end checklist
- [x] Mark reviewed skills as REVIEWED in PLAN.md
- [x] Run any formatting/lint checks relevant to docs (if any)

Notes:
- Ran `npm run typecheck`; it currently fails in this repo with existing TypeScript errors unrelated to the Rust skill markdown changes.
