Build the first and most important Rust skill — the paradigm shift skill. Encodes core 'think in Rust' principles that agents consistently fail to apply: newtypes for domain strings, enums over booleans, explicit unknowns, exhaustive matching, domain error variants, parse don't validate, enums as primary modeling tool, borrow by default.

- [ ] Write SKILL.md with frontmatter, rules, decision frameworks, review checklist
- [ ] Create references/ directory with deep-dive content
- [ ] Write README.md with catalog entry and attribution
- [ ] Review for quality — every rule earns its token cost
