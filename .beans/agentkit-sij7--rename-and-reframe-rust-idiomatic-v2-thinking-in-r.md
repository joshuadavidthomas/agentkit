Rename the combined rust-idiomatic + rust-idioms skill from 'rust-idiomatic-v2' to 'thinking-in-rust'. The v2 already uses 'Think in Rust' as its title — this makes the skill name match the framing. More evocative than 'idiomatic' and better at tickling the latent space of agents using the skill.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create skills/thinking-in-rust/ directory with renamed SKILL.md
- [ ] Reframe the description and frontmatter for the new name
- [ ] Copy all reference files
- [ ] Review prose for consistency with 'Thinking in Rust' framing
- [ ] Clean up the old rust-idiomatic-v2 directory
