Quality review the **skills/rust-testing** skill against the Rust skills review checklist and the **skill-authoring** guidelines. Fix issues directly (tone, prescriptiveness, references, compile-correct examples, common mistakes, review checklist).

## Checklist
- [x] Read current SKILL.md + references and check structure (frontmatter, cross-links, under 500 lines)
- [x] Make content prescriptive and remove low-value descriptive text
- [x] Ensure code examples are self-contained and compile with appropriate dev-deps
- [x] Verify reference links exist and match claims
- [x] Update PLAN.md status if needed (DONE → DONE (REVIEWED))
